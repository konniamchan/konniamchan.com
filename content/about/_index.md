I'm a data scientist at [IdentityMind](https://www.identitymindglobal.com/). We focus on building trusted digital identities for merchants and financial institutions. I graduated from UC Berkeley School of Information with a Master of Information and Data Science. Prior to graduate school, I ran an apparel business and worked as an investment analyst at [Dodge & Cox](https://dodgeandcox.com/).
