# Kilauea

Crown jewel of Hawaii. The still erupting volcano was the highlight of our trip.

We started from Kalapana and hiked three hours on uneven volcanic rocks, before reaching the cliff where lava entered the ocean, by around sunset. The sights and sounds were pure bliss and magic.

# Akaka Falls

At Akaka Falls, water falls down hundreds of feet down the side of mountains covered with lush green rain forests.

# Luau

Brave fire-breathers and exceptional food made for the perfect evening. Great opportunities to drag the shutter for some wonderful shots.
